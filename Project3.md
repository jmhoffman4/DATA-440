# Project 3
## Q1
Following the tutorial from Dr Ds Idiots Guide to Spatial Interaction Modelling for Dummies - Part 1: The Unconstrained (Total Constrained) Model, I was able to implement a gravity model of London. Using adm level population and income statistics, the tutorial walked me through how to implement the model. The tutorial produced this matrix of comings and goings, which takes into account aforementioned indicators to determine the probability of migration.
