## Provide a written description of your selected household survey including the number of household and person observations as well as the variables in your source data.
After requesting household survey data for Palestine (my original country of choice), I found that there was not sufficient data from other sources to continue the analysis. Unfortunately, I also had a similar experience afterwards and ended up trying and failing to find sufficient GPS (or other) data for Ghana, Zambia, and Egypt (size problem), I landed on Togo. This was a significant setback in my progress. I utilized the most recent DHS household survey, which was from 2013-14. The survey consists of 9549 households across Togo. The collected information used in this analysis are as follows: hhid (household id), hv004 area unit, hv005 (weights), size(hv009), shregion (region of residence), hv009 (household size), hv104_01-46 (sex of hh members), hv105_01-46 (age of hh members), hv106_01-46 (education level of hh members), and hv270 (wealth of hh).
