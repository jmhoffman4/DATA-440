## 1. Provide a written description of your selected household survey including the number of household and person observations as well as the variables in your source data.
After requesting household survey data for Palestine (my original country of choice), I found that there was not sufficient data from other sources to continue the analysis. Unfortunately, I also had a similar experience afterwards and ended up trying and failing to find sufficient GPS (or other) data for Ghana, Zambia, and Egypt (size problem), I landed on Togo. This was a significant setback in my progress. I utilized the most recent DHS household survey, which was from 2013-14. The survey consists of 9549 households across Togo. The collected information used in this analysis are as follows: hhid (household id), hv004 area unit, hv005 (weights), size(hv009), shregion (region of residence), hv009 (household size), hv104_01-46 (sex of hh members), hv105_01-46 (age of hh members), hv106_01-46 (education level of hh members), and hv270 (wealth of hh). The average size of household in Togo is 4.6 persons.

## 2.	Provide a written description of your spatially located households at the adm0 level of your selected location, including how you located each household, generated the household structure including demographic attributes of persons, and the percent error calculated. If you faced computational issues at the adm0 level when attempting to pivot from households to persons, describe those limitations.

The sum of hhs weights is similar to the number of rows in the survey data, although there was a slightly odd occurrence. The sum of weights adds up to the same combination of numbers as the nrows, but is multiplied by a factor of 6, such that the division of sum(hhs$weights)/nrow(hhs) = 1e+06. \ 
The first approach to mapping households at the adm0 level was to appoint observations from the household data to random points, tailored to the population density raster from worldpop. This approach resulted in the following map, where each dot is a household/observation. \
