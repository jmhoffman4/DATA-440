## OSMnx

   OSMnx is a Python package for analyzing street systems. Using downloadable spatial geometry data, OSMnx allows the user to create a model of streetways, bike lanes, cross-walks, and landmarks among other things. You can manipulate your model on the fly and run simulations to analyze the system of paths. This package has the potential to change the way city planners design metropolitan areas. Additionally, the possibilities for discovery may revolutionize spatial logic and order, especially in highly populated areas. OSMnx allows for new precedence to be set in Data Science, through analysis of streetway entropy, configuration, and orientation. This package allows for widespread study of worldwide trends in street networks.
   Entropy in this case refers to a street networks relative order or disorder. The package allows for the possibility of quantifying the entropy of a given network, and the role of entropy in the trends of worldwide street systems. A quantifiable measure of order/disorder in streets would allow for targeting specific patterns of spatial order to improve the welfare of the public. This improvement to the welfare could be rearranging of street patterns and maximization of commercial space. Additional space in urban areas has a clear benefit to the population. This additional space could allow for increased availability of housing, particualarly low-rent housing in areas with high levels of homelessness.
   OSMnx also allows for representation and analysis of landmarks such as buildings, ameneties, and any other feature with spatial significance. The potential of these functions paired with the street network analysis would allow for incredibly in-depth research for the planning of parks, plazas, and industrial complexes. While there are other benefits like increased street network efficiency overall, the most exciting benefit of OSMnx remains the space maximizing potential. The pandemic has certainly had lasting effects on the population, and many people have lost jobs and living situations. The possibility for additional public/commercial space where housing facilities could be established to provide the basic right of shelter is certainly an enticing solution to improving general welfare where it was currently thought impossible.
   A main limitation to the application of OSMnx is the lack of detailed spatial data on street networks. A cost efficient method to construct high resolution spatial data for metropolitan areas would unlock the potential of OSMnx.
