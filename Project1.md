# Project 1:

## Part 1a: Geometric Bar Plot

## Part 1b: Plot of the de facto settlement boundaries with geometric measures of population and density for all locations.

### Also, include a description and analysis of the system of settlements that populate your selected location:

The densest settlements in Jericho are mostly around the center of the region, there are also main roads leading to most of the largest settlements in that area.  There is also a lack of hospitals and HCF's in Jericho, while Jerusalem is far more 'developed' in this sense. There were a few missing settlements in Jerusalem, which I uncovered by altering the filters. Jerusalem is home to the largest AND densest settlement in the selected area. This settlement is in central Jerusalem and is noticeably larger in population and density, indicated by the size and bright color of said settlement on the plot. I was hoping that the sparseness of Jericho and density of populations in Jerusalem would provide an interesting sample and I was not dissappointed.

## Part 1c

### Provide an analysis of the system of settlements sizes and relative location to one another:
Settlements are largely close together in these regions of Palestine. There is vast space of sparsely populated areas for the majority of space, with a handful of larger settlements in the central areas of both Jericho and Jerusalem. In Jericho, settlements are clearly organized in a North to South fashion, a structure that is strengthened by the main road that runs from North to South as well. Many of the smaller settlements are grouped closely together around the central area, this makes sense given the tall, narrow nature of the region. In Jerusalem, there is essentially one huge central settlement and a handful of smaller ones dotted around it in the rural areas of the region. To support such a dense central population, there are many hospitals and other HCF's in Jerusalem, especially near the settlement. There is more un-settled territory in Jerusalem by looking at the plot, the entire Eastern portion of the region is sparsely populated, as is the adjacent area of Jericho just North of that, to a certain extent. In summary, Jerusalem is more highly populated and developed, looking at population, density, and HCF concentration. In contrast, Jericho is sparsely populated over a wider range of space compared to Jerusalem. Jericho also contains far less HCFs and roads, especially as you move North away from the hotspot of Jerusalem.

### Provide an analysis of the transportation network and its capacity to facilitate access across your selected area:


It should be noted that given the level of roadway mapped, Jericho lacks roadways other than the main one going through the center. A possible explanation for this is that there is a large network of smaller roads that is not captured in the plot. Although, taking into account only whats shown on the plot, it can be assumed that travel laterally through Jericho is not as easy as traveling North to South. There is however, am intricate network of lateral and vertical roadways in Ramallah and Al-Bireh, a region West of Jericho that is not included in the plot. There is a much more comprehensive road network in Jerusalem, which is to be expected given the large nature of the settlement relative to the rest of the area. The large amount of HCF's in Jerusalem neccesitate a more advanced transportation infrastructure compared to Jericho, which only has one hospital at the end of the main highway.
## Part 1d

### Topography:
I actually was able to get the topography working about 3/4 days ago, but have been unable to since moving to a new more concise script. The issue I ran into was the function PNG::Readpng() not working and telling me that my png file was not a png. I workshopped this issue multiple times and could not find a way to overcome it in time for submission, although I will be revisting it later to see if I can get it working, any tips on this are appreciated of course!!
