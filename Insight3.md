## LiDAR


LiDAR, also known as Light Detection and Ranging is a remote sensing technology that is most often utlized to mode l geospatial data of landscapes. These lanscapes can range from desert to shallow water or construction project sites. Using optical remote sensing, LiDAR can generate the required geospatial information to model the charcateristics of a landscape, including the general shape, the surface characteristics, and even pollutant levels. While LiDAR has been used to analyze the surface of the Earth, the atmosphere, and shallow water areas, it has not yet been applied to marine landscapes.\

The benefit of applying LiDAR to marine landscapes is the ability to analyze habitat locations and shoreline changes among other things. We all know that climate change poses a truly behemoth threat to many wildlife populations across the globe. Marine life has certainly been effected by climate change in a unique way as well, particularly in terms of the rising water levels and melting ice. Increased temperatures along with these other changes in climate pose a real threat to already endangerd animal populations. LiDAR allows for in depth evaluation of trends in water levels, pollution, temperatures, and shorelines. We can use this information to identify the most effective methods to reverse the adverse effects of climate change and to best aid the populations of species who need our help. There is another use for LiDAR that will benefit human populations.\

LiDAR modelling of marine landscapes included with the landscape of the adjacent shoreline data, a user could analyze the effect of various weather phenomena. By identifying weaknesses in shoreline community landscape structure, we can better prevent tragedy in the wake of a hurricane or flood. The ability to superimpose projected sea levels based on real world data points means that we can better plan for rising sea levels, as well as the effect of potential nature related tragedies on land based structures. This could be especially useful for areas that comomonly suffer from natural disasters like typhoons or hurricanes. Adjustment of shoreline structure and more effectively targeted overflow outlets for rising water are just a couple of the potential benefits to LiDAR application in marine landscapes.
